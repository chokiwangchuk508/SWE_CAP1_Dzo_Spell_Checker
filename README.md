Maintaining Readability:
Challenge: Large dictionaries or nested structures can make code hard to read and maintain.
Solution: Keep the code well-documented, use helper functions, and break complex operations into smaller, manageable parts.
terating and Modifying:
Challenge: Modifying a dictionary while iterating over it can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.
Solution: Create a list of keys to modify after the iteration is complete or use dictionary comprehensions for transformations
Key Uniqueness:
Challenge: Ensuring that keys are unique to avoid unintentional data overwrites.
Solution: Implement checks before adding keys, or use a different data structure (like lists) if duplicates are needed.
